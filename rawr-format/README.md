Rawr Format
===========

[![Build status][travis-badge]][travis-link]

[*Rawr Format*][1] is a Haskell implementation of the Roaring Bitmaps
[serialisation format][3]. Roaring Bitmaps are a compressed bitmap
data structure offering better space and time performance than other
compressed bitmaps in many situations. This library implements the
interoperable serialisation format supported by many implementations.

**Please note:** This is a work in progress and is not yet ready for
use. When complete it will be released on Hackage.
